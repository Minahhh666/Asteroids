# Asteroids

"Asteroids" is a classic arcade video game that was released in 1979 by Atari. It's considered one of the most iconic and influential games of its time and is often remembered for its simple yet addictive gameplay.

In "Asteroids," players control a small spaceship that can rotate and move in any direction. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible while shooting and destroying incoming asteroids and avoiding collisions with them. As the game progresses, the number of asteroids increases, and they split into smaller pieces when shot. Players must also evade flying saucers that appear and shoot at the player's ship.
